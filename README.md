# Nexis Clicker

_Nexis Uni_ is the only source for newspaper articles and press releases[^1], they practically have a monopoly on it. Since they do not have an API[^2], one needs to click through their database manually and download the articles bit by bit. There are limits on the number of articles per download, and on the number of downloads per day, so this is a very slow and tedious process. This scripts automates the process to some extent by doing the clickwork for you. The limits are similar as for the manual downloading, it is very slow and the amount of articles is limited. But at least you don't need to click yourself any more.

[^1]: For online newspaper articles, there is also the open portal [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org). For print newspaper articles in German-speaking countries, there is the [German Reference Corpus](https://www.ids-mannheim.de/digspra/kl/projekte/korpora/), but I am not aware of similar databases for other countries. I have searched extensively, but there is only Nexis Uni and the other (Lexis)Nexis products.

[^2]: There is a "URL API", but that has nothing to do with a REST API.
